[Understanding Prototypes and Inheritance in JavaScript](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-prototypes-and-inheritance-in-javascript) | Tania Rascia | JavaScript is a prototype-based language, meaning object properties and methods can be shared through generalized objects that have the ability to be cloned and extended.

[Understanding Prototypes and Inheritance in JavaScript](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-prototypes-and-inheritance-in-javascript) | Tania Rascia | JavaScript is a prototype-based language, meaning object properties and methods can be shared through generalized objects that have the ability to be cloned and extended. This is known as prototypical inheritance and differs from class inheritance. Among popular object-oriented programming languages, JavaScript is relatively unique, as other prominent languages such as PHP, Python, and Java are class-based languages, which instead define classes as blueprints for objects.
